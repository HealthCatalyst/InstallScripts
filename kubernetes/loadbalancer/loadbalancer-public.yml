  # Special notes for Azure: To use user-specified public type loadBalancerIP, a static type public IP address resource needs to be created first, 
  # and it should be in the same resource group of the cluster. 
  # note that in the case of AKS, that resource group is MC_<resourcegroup>_<cluster>
  # Then you could specify the assigned IP address as loadBalancerIP
