# Note: depending on your network configuration, you might also have to change
the postgres configuration files to allow certain IPs to access the database.
# These files are:
# /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf - Can be used to control which ips have
access to the database.
# /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf - Can be used to control the
connections the database listens for.
# You also might have to edit IP tables (depending on your server and network
configuration).
