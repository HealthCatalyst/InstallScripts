# set -e option instructs bash to immediately exit if any command [1] has a non-zero exit status
# when set -u is set, a reference to any variable you haven't previously defined - with the exceptions of $* and $@ - is an error, and causes the program to immediately exit
# set -o pipefail: If any command in a pipeline fails, that return code will be used as the return code of the whole pipeline
